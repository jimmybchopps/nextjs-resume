This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It was modified to use MUIv5 with some minimal theming to allow easy customization.

## Getting Started

Run the following command to install the required components:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the following command to run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is designed to be an easy-start resume template with all data hosted locally in data.js file under the api directory. This template is also mobile ready so it should still look great when viewed on a phone. The layout is designed to provide a quick overview of your skills and experience in an easy to consume manner.

## Customizations

The vast majority of all CSS styling and theming is located in the theme.js file under the utils folder. Check out the following links to see how to modify any specific components. The link for the color palette is also included below.
